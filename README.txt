Running the program:
python3 categorize_calendar.py
Then manually enter the categories. These get written to a file locally. See categories.txt for possible entries. Enter them as comma delimited.

Then run
python3 analyse_calendary.py
These create a dictionary of events to categories.

TODO: write dictionary locally. Use this while getting more input data so that only new events require manual input.

TODO: process time data to see how much time is spent per category per week
